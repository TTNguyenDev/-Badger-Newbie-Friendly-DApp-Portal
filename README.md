## Newbie Friendly DApp Portal

### Design: https://www.figma.com/file/FBVS49AoCHIdvWBIhB0fkF/Untitled?node-id=2%3A59477
<b>Description:</b> Defi portals have a ton of complexity and information that is displayed for users, some of which is too much for a new or average user. This can be intimidating and cause reduction in conversion rates. BadgerDAO?s product vision is to have a ?Newbie Friendly? one click deposit and earn function that ?just works?

This bounty is a design bounty to deliver a mock up of a Badger Lite app that has the option to deposit directly into 2 options, one that receives a lower ROI but is compounded in strictly bitcoin (ibBTC), the other receiving a higher ROI and receiving partner tokens / badger as emissions (badger tricrypto vault).

<b>Expectations</b>

Deliver a mock up of the main dapp page and any ancillary information pages
Use the badger dapp theme as an example to make it cohesive with other products.



# My work
Badger DAO Lite is very easy to use. I followed UI/UX of uniswap. We will have three tabs: Home, Earn, and Profile. We used elementary words so a beginner could easily understand. 


## Homepage
We have two shortcut features on the Homepage that allow the user to deposit their money directly into ibBTC or Tricrypto. We also have some pairs that people use most.

- Click ibBTC button: Your browser will redirect to https://app.badger.com/ibBTC
- Click tricrypto button: Your browser will redirect to https://app.badger.com/
